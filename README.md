<h1 align="center">👋 Hello, I’m Akshay Praneeth</h1> <p align="center"><i>"Great products aren't built with features. They're built with belief."</i></p>

✨ Who I Am

I'm a builder at heart.
Not of code, but of clarity.
Not just of products, but of possibilities.

I believe in designing experiences that just work—not because they're complex, but because they feel inevitable. As a product manager, my mission is simple:
Make things people want. Strip away the rest.

🧭 What Drives Me

Curiosity over convention

Intuition shaped by insight

Bold questions, not safe answers

The pursuit of simplicity in a noisy world

📁 This Repository

This space isn’t about showing off.
It’s about showing why I build what I build.

portfolio/ – Problems I chose to solve

case-studies/ – Decisions that mattered

writing/ – What I think, and how I think

🧰 Tools Are Just Tools
Figma, Miro, Notion, Jira, Postman…
They don’t define the work.
The why does.
