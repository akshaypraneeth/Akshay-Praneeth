🎥 TeamPulse – Real-Time Communication for Distributed Teams
Role: Product Consultant
Type: B2B SaaS | Audio/Video Communication
Duration: 2023 – 2024

🚩 Problem / Opportunity
- Remote teams were relying heavily on scheduled Zoom/Meet calls or scattered Slack threads. The problem?

- Too many scheduled calls disrupted flow

- Asynchronous tools lacked emotional nuance

- Casual, spontaneous communication was dying

Opportunity:
Can we design a real-time audio/video solution for distributed teams to recreate the spontaneity and warmth of in-office conversations—without overloading calendars?

🎯 Goals
- Create lightweight, real-time voice/video interaction without the need for scheduling

- Foster informal “drop-in” conversations across teams

- Improve cross-functional collaboration and employee connection

- Reduce Zoom fatigue and communication lag

🧭 Approach / Process
🔍 Discovery & Research
- Interviewed 12 remote team members across departments

- Mapped the emotional fatigue of constant scheduled calls

- Studied tools like Discord (voice channels), Loom, Around, and Tandem

Key Insight:
Teams missed ambient awareness—knowing who’s around and casually available for a quick chat or check-in.

✏️ Ideation & Validation
- Conceptualized “Virtual Pods” — persistent, topic-based audio/video rooms that mimic breakout zones

- Designed real-time status indicators (e.g., “Available to talk”, “In deep work”)

- Created rapid mockups and ran them by 5 internal teams for feedback

Early Feedback:

- Users loved the ability to “peek in” without pressure

- Wanted controls like invisible mode, mute-first entry, and privacy toggles

🔧 Build & Collaborate
- Partnered with backend team to implement WebRTC-based audio/video infrastructure

- Built frontend with React and Tailwind, integrating daily.co for video API

- Developed smart presence logic and "tap to talk" lightweight UI for instant access

🔁 Test & Iterate
- Ran private beta with 3 cross-functional teams

- Tracked usage patterns, session durations, number of spontaneous vs. scheduled interactions

- Collected qualitative feedback weekly and adapted UX accordingly

📈 Outcome / Impact
- 60% increase in informal team interactions over 30 days

- Scheduled meeting count dropped by 22%

- Teams reported better context sharing and faster decision-making

- HR flagged improved team sentiment and less Zoom burnout in pulse surveys

💡 Reflection
- This case taught me how human behavior meets real-time tech.
- Designing not just for functionality—but for comfort, spontaneity, and emotional bandwidth—was the biggest unlock.

If done again:

- I’d invest earlier in native mobile support

- More experiments around async voice (like walkie-talkie mode) could’ve improved adoption in low-bandwidth regions
